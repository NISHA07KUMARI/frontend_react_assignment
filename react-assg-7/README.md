# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Assignment

### Assignment 6:

Create a React program based on the below requirements:\
a. The main program passes the below immutable variables to the “App” \
component which are Name, Preferred cities and Age.\
b. We need to also apply the below validations to the above passed values:\
i. Name : Should be string type and is mandatory\
ii. Preferred cities: Should be an array type\
iii. Age: Should be a number and should be greater than or equal to 18 \
and less than or equal to 60.\
c. In case the values do not get passed, then we should use the default values \
as: Name: Steve, Preferred cities: [Bangalore, Chennai] and Age: 18.\
d. While testing and executing this app, try to pass values which do not cater to \
the required validation rules and see how you get warnings in the console \
(capture these console outputs and submit during assignment submission)\

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
